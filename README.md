  #Generation Brazil Boot Camp
  ### I am currently studying at the Generation boot camp. The boot camp program helps us students to develop not only our hard skills, but also our soft skills.
  ### Everyday I am being challenged with coding while working on a team. Thus, I have learned about agile SCRUM methodology, and also improved my team work.
